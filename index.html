            <h2>Welcome to my mind.</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                I grew up shy, but I’ve been slowly blooming over my life. For a long time, I thought learning was
                mostly about studying, memorizing, and performing well in school. But I came into the light during my
                university years, when I met people from backgrounds I could’ve never imagined before. Talking to people
                brought me closer to that light. It taught me that we don’t just hold different opinions, we carry
                different perspectives on the same ideas, and that those differences exist for a reason. They reveal
                depth. They expand what’s possible to understand.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                That shift changed everything. For a long time, I thought I was learning just because I was studying.
                But I only truly learned when I began to see how connected everything is, and that no concept stands
                alone. Everything feeds into everything else like an ecosystem, and once you notice that, it’s hard to
                stop noticing. That’s why I made it a hobby of mine to research by reading any book, article, or
                speculative fiction piece I could get my hands on. I like ideas, but I love the links between ideas, the
                way history, philosophy, science, and technology constantly echo each other.
            </p>

                Covid-19 became a turning point. Isolation brought in a new wave of self-discovery, but it also
                clarified something I had been resisting: I need community to grow. Living life as a hermit had gone on
                long
                enough, and I craved being part of a scholarly space again, the kind where learning feels alive and
                shared, not just private and quiet.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I’ve always felt that humans should be constantly evolving, and I still try to push myself forward in
                new and novel directions every day. Lately, I’ve been worried about the state of the world. I’ve always
                enjoyed studying history, but being part of it in this way was not on my bucket list. These are
                confusing times, and they are stressful. Still, the hope I’ve always tried to hold onto is that dark
                times can lead to a new age of light, something that can make us feel proud to be human again.
